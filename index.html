            <h2>About Chic.</h2>
            <p class="lead">Eating out with friends is nice, but you remember why you don’t do it more often when it comes down to splitting the check. It was a continuous struggle for us top. So with our efforts and collaboration, we came up with a simple solution — money pooling. You join a check, tap a button, and off you go.As a team, We talked with servers and managers, and found out they value time above all. The faster they can clear tables, the faster they can seat more people. From there, the idea evolved into an end-to-end platform for restaurants and groups that can efficiently and intuitively eliminate their struggles. Through this platform, Chic hopes to build trust, connection, and independence within our client base.
